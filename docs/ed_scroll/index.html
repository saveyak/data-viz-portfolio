But this creates an inherent disparity: the wealthier the neighborhood, the more property is worth, and the more funding its schools get.</p> <p>Because property values tend to be lower in predominantly Black neighborhoods than in White neighborhoods, predominantly Black schools often get less funding. That leads to disparities like these:</p>  <figure>  <div style="text-align:center;height:100%;width:100%">   <img src="/r_circle_map_just_va.d07ba58a.png" alt="A map of the Northeast region of the United States.

The authors calculated the difference in local property tax revenue between Black and White students using data from the U.S. Census Fiscal Survey of Local Governments. They calculated state aid based on the state's general funding formula.
