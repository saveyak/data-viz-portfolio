  <h1><strong>Ranked choice voting</strong></h1>
  <p><em>Skills used: JavaScript, D3, Python</em></p>

  <p>In June 2021, the citizens of New York headed to the polls to vote in the mayoral primaries, but this time the polls looked a little different. For the first time, the city used ranked-choice voting, which meant that instead of voting for just candidate, voters could rank their top 5 choices in order of preference.</p>
  <p>To find the winner, election officials hold several rounds of vote-counting. Each round, candidates are ranked by the number of votes and the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Several candidates can be eliminated at once if their combined vote total is less than the next candidate ranked above them. Votes for eliminated candidates are then redistributed to the remaining candidates based on who voters picked as their next choice.</p>

<h2>How I build this project</h2>
    <p>For this project, I used Python to scrape election results from the Board of Elections website and then created a D3 data animation to show how the process of ranked-choice voting played out in the Democratic primary election.</p>
